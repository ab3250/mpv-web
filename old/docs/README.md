# mpv-ipc.js

This is a simple, mostly dumb, client for [mpv](https://mpv.io)'s [IPC interface](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/blob/master/DOCS/man/ipc.rst).
It translates any method calls into IPC commands for mpv according to the following rules:

* Explicitly implemented commands like `observeProperty()` (see [commands](#explicit-commands) below);
* IPC-only commands as listed in the [IPC interface documentation](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/blob/master/DOCS/man/ipc.rst#commands)
  (such as `clientName()` -> `client_name`);
* Methods starting with `on` or `off` are translated into event handler addition/deletion for their corresponding dash-case events;
* Methods starting with `get`, `set`, `observe`, `toggle`/`cycle`, `adjust`/`add`, `scale`/`multiply` are translated into
  their corresponding `get_property`, `set_property`, `observe_property`, `cycle`, `add` and `multiply` commands with the property translated to dash-case;
* Finally, the entire command is translated into dash-case and attempted as an IPC input-style command.

The IPC interface is fully asynchronous and every command (except for event handler registration) returns a 
[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise).
On success, `resolve()` is called with the result data and on failure `reject()` is called with the error message from mpv.

## Explicit commands

* `MPVClient(socketPath)`: create a client communicating with the IPC socket on `socketPath`;
* `MPVClient.on(event, handler)`: register an event handler for raw IPC event `event`;
* `MPVClient.off(event, handler)`: unregister an event handler for raw IPC event `event`;
* `MPVClient.command(...args)`: send raw command over IPC interface (equivalent to `socket.write(JSON.stringify({command: args}))`);
* `MPVClient.observeProperty(property, handler)`: observe changes for the given `property` and invoke `handler` with the new value once it changes;
* `MPVClient.play()`: alias for `MPVClient.setPause(false)`;
* `MPVClient.pause()`: alias for `MPVClient.setPause(true)`;
* `MPVClient.resume()`: alias for `MPVClient.setPause(false)`;
* `MPVClient.mute()`: alias for `MPVClient.setMute(true)`;
* `MPVClient.unmute()`: alias for `MPVClient.setMute(false)`;
* `MPVClient.loop()`: alias for `MPVClient.setLoop(n < 0 ? "inf" : n)`;

## Magic-less usage

If all the method translation magic is too much for you, and you'd just like to use the explicit commands above only (save for the aliases and observeProperty),
you can instantiate a `BasicMPVClient` instead of `MPVClient`, which will omit all the magic translations.

## Example

```js
let mpv = require('mpv-ipc');
let player = new mpv.MPVClient('/tmp/mpv.sock');

/** Basic IPC commands */

player.getProperty('volume').then(v => console.log('Volume: ' + v));
/* or: */
player.getVolume().then(v => console.log('Volume: ' + v));

player.adjustVolume(5); /* raise volume by 5 */

player.observeProperty('media-title', t => console.log('Title changed: ' + t));
/* or: */
player.observeMediaTitle(t => console.log('Title changed: ' + t));

player.on('end-file', e => console.log('File ended.'));
/* or: */
player.onEndFile(e => console.log('File ended.'));

/** Making use of the input interface (https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/blob/master/DOCS/man/input.rst) */

/* As every function just returns a promise, you can use the async/await functionality for cleaner access,
 * especially if you want to wait for events. */
async function f(player) {
    await player.loadfile('/Users/you/Downloads/not-an-anime-episode.mkv');
    await player.seek(420, 'absolute');
    await player.screenshotToFile('/Users/you/Pictures/lewd-scene.png', 'video');
}
```
